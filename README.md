🚑 Smart Healthcare Prediction System
A cutting-edge healthcare analytics solution that leverages Hybrid Machine Learning Techniques and Big Data analytics on Cloud to deliver real-time, scalable, and accurate predictions of potential health risks based on patient data.

🧠 Key Features
💡 Hybrid ML Models: Combines traditional algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) with Deep Learning (e.g., CNN, LSTM) for more accurate disease prediction.

☁️ Cloud-Based Deployment: Scalable architecture deployed on cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure) using tools like Hadoop, Spark, or BigQuery.

📊 Big Data Integration: Processes large volumes of health records efficiently using big data pipelines.

🧬 Smart Prediction Engine: Predicts diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and more based on real-time and historical patient data.

🔐 Secure and Compliant: Implements strong data protection and privacy mechanisms following healthcare regulations.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React / HTML / CSS / Bootstrap (if applicable)

Backend: Flask / Django / Node.js

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, XGBoost

Big Data Tools: Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kafka

Cloud Platforms: AWS / GCP / Azure

Database: MongoDB / MySQL / HDFS

🧪 How It Works
📥 Upload patient records (CSV, JSON, or real-time stream).

🔍 Data is preprocessed and stored using cloud storage (e.g., S3, HDFS).

🤖 Hybrid ML models analyze the data.

📈 Results (diagnosis, predictions) are displayed via a user dashboard.

☁️ All data is managed and processed in a scalable cloud environment.
